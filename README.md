## 📌 Note from the Developer

> *"This is my third bot project, so you might notice parts of the code that look a bit rough or experimental — like leftover scaffolding or messy logic. That’s just part of the journey. I’m constantly refining it.
Also, I’ve left the MySQL-related code in the files — feel free to copy and paste it into your own project if it helps."* 😅
